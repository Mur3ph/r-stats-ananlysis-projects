#Declaring variables:
	x = 32
	x <- 32
	x <- y <- 32 						#Both x and y are assigned 32
	assign("name_of_variable", 32)
	rm(name_of_variable)				#Removes varialbe, helps free up memory
	
	a = 32
	b = "hello"
	class(a)							#Prints variable type
	is.numeric(b)						#Boolean check, is. has many built-in functions
